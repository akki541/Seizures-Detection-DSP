## Introduction
Epileptic seizures are caused by abnormal electrical discharges in the brain. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals provide a way to monitor these discharges. This project utilizes DSP techniques for detecting seizure activity in EEG signals, aiming to support real-time diagnosis.

## Features
- **Signal Preprocessing**: Removal of noise and artifacts using a low-pass FIR filter with Kaiser window.
- **Frequency Analysis**: Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for identifying significant frequency patterns in EEG signals.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Use of mean and standard deviation to analyze EEG signal variability for seizure detection.
- **Visualizations**: Time-domain and frequency-domain plots for signal interpretation.

## Methodology
1. **Data Acquisition**:
   - EEG signals are sourced from publicly available datasets.
   - Signals are filtered to remove frequencies outside the 0â€“30 Hz band.

2. **Signal Filtering**:
   - FIR low-pass filter with Kaiser window to enhance signal quality.

3. **Frequency Domain Analysis**:
   - Application of FFT to convert EEG signals into the frequency domain and identify seizure-specific frequency components.

4. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Statistical parameters, such as mean and standard deviation, are computed to detect variability in EEG signals.

5. **Visualization**:
   - Plots are generated to compare seizure and non-seizure signals in both time and frequency domains.
